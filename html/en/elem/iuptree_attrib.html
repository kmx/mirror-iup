<h2>IupTree Attributes</h2>
<h3><a name="global">General</a></h3>
<p><strong>ADDEXPANDED</strong>:
  Defines if branches will be expanded when 
  created. The root node is always 
  expanded when created. Possible values: &quot;YES&quot; =
    The branches will be created expanded; &quot;NO&quot; =
    The branches will be created collapsed. Default:
    &quot;YES&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>CANFOCUS</strong> (creation only) (<font size="3">non inheritable</font>): enables the focus traversal of the 
control. Default: YES. (since 3.0)</p>

  
<p><a href="../attrib/iup_expand.html">EXPAND</a> (<font size="3">non inheritable</font>): 
The default value is &quot;YES&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>HIDEBUTTONS</strong> (creation only): hide the expand and collapse 
buttons. In GTK, branches will be only expanded programatically. In Motif it did 
not work and crash the test. (since 3.0)</p>

  
<p><strong>HIDELINES</strong> (creation only): hide the lines that connect the 
nodes in the hierarchy. (since 3.0)</p>
<p><strong>INDENTATION</strong>: sets the identation level in pixels. The visual 
effect of changing the indentation is highly system dependent. In GTK it acts as 
an addtional ident value, and lines does not follow the extra indent. In Windows 
is limited to a minimum of 5 pixels. (since 3.0)</p>

  
<p> 
<a href="../attrib/iup_rastersize.html">RASTERSIZE</a> (<font size="3">non inheritable</font>): 
the initial size is &quot;400x200&quot;. Set to NULL to allow the automatic 
layout use smaller values.</p>
<p><b>RENAMECARET</b>:
  Allows specifying and verifying the caret&#8217;s 
  position of the text box when in-place renaming.</p>
<p><b>RENAMESELECTION</b>:
  Allows specifying and verifying selection 
  interval 
  of the text box when in-place renaming.</p>
<p><strong>SHOWDRAGDROP</strong>: Shows a drag cursor if the user drags a node or 
  branch and enables the <strong>DRAGDROP_CB</strong> callback. Default:
  &quot;NO&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>SHOWRENAME</strong>: Allows the in place rename of a node. The 
<strong>RENAME_CB</strong> is called after the user entered a new name, instead of calling
  <strong>RENAME_NODE_CB</strong> to notify the user that it should rename a node. 
  Default:
  &quot;NO&quot;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="style1"><strong>SPACING</strong>: internal padding for each item. Notice that 
vertically the distance between each item will be actually 2x the spacing. It 
also affects the horizontal margin of the item. In Windows, the text is aligned 
at the top left of the item always. Valid only when DROPDOWN=NO. (since 3.0)</p>

  
<p class="style1"><strong>TOPITEM</strong> (write-only): position the given item at the top of 
the list or make it visible. Valid only when DROPDOWN=NO. (since 3.0)</p>

<h3><a name="marks">Marks</a></h3>
<p><strong>VALUE</strong>:
  The selected node. When changed also marks the node, but only 
  if the Control and Shift keys are not used. Possible values:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="info">
The node identifier to be selected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="info">When changed also accepts the values:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="info">&quot;ROOT&quot;:
      the root node<br>
&quot;LAST&quot;:
      the last node<br>
&quot;PGUP&quot;:
      the node one page below<br>
&quot;PGDN&quot;:
      the node one page above<br>
&quot;NEXT&quot;:
      the node 
following the selected node. If the selected node is the last one, the 
      last one will be used instead <br>
&quot;PREVIOUS&quot;:
      the previous node of 
the selected node. If the selected node is the root, 
the root will be used instead</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="info">
The following values are also accepted but they are 
independent from the state of the Control and Shift keys, and from the CTRL and SHIFT attributes. And the selected node is <u>not</u> changed. These values are kept here for 
    backward compatibility, but they would fit better in the MARKED attribute.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="info">&quot;INVERT&quot;:
      Inverts the node's marking. Using the &quot;INVERTid&quot; form, where id is the node identifier, it is possible to 
      invert the marking of any node.<br>
&quot;BLOCK&quot;:
      Marks all nodes between the selected node 
      and the initial block-marking node (see Navigation / Multiple Marking)<br>
&quot;CLEARALL&quot;:
      Unmarks all nodes<br>
&quot;MARKALL&quot;:
      Marks all nodes<br>
&quot;INVERTALL&quot;:
      Inverts the marking of all nodes</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="info">The selected node is scrolled so it becames visible.</p>
<p><strong>MARKED</strong>: The marking state of the selected node. Using 
  the MARKEDid form, where id is the node identifier, it is possible to 
  retrieve or change the marking state of any node. Possible values: &quot;YES&quot; 
=
    The node is marked; &quot;NO&quot; =
    The node is not marked.</p>
<p><strong>CTRL</strong>:
  Activates or deactivates the Control key 
  function. Possible values: &quot;YES&quot; =
    Control key activated, allows marking 
    individual nodes; &quot;NO&quot; =
    Control key deactivated, does not allow 
    marking individual nodes.
    Default:
    &quot;NO&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>SHIFT</strong>:
  Activates or deactivates the Shift key 
  function. Possible values: &quot;YES&quot; =
    Shift key activated, allows marking adjacent 
    nodes; &quot;NO&quot; =
    Shift key deactivated, does not allow 
    marking adjacent nodes.
    Default:
    &quot;NO&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>STARTING</strong>:
  Defines the initial node for the block 
  marking. The value must be the node identifier.
    Default:
    root node.</p>
<h3><a name="images">Images</a></h3>
<p><strong>IMAGEid</strong>:
  the image that will be shown on a 
  specific node. Valid for leaves and for collapsed branches. This attribute must always be used with the id number.
  This attribute can only be set (write-only - id dependent attributes are not 
stored). Ex. &quot;IMAGE2&quot;.</p>
<p class="info">An image is internally duplicated at the moment is set. So the 
application does not need to keep the image after setting the attribute. This is 
valid for all IMAGE* attributes of the IupTree.</p>
<p><strong>IMAGEEXPANDEDid</strong>:
  the image that will be shown on a 
  specific node. It has no effect over leaves and is valid only for expanded branches. This attribute must always be used 
  with the id number. 
  This attribute can only be set (write-only - id dependent attributes are not 
stored). Ex. &quot;IMAGEEXPANDED3&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>IMAGELEAF</strong>:
  the image that will be shown for all 
  leaves. Internal values &quot;IMGBLANK&quot; and &quot;IMGPAPER&quot; are 
    also available.</p>
<p><strong>IMAGEBRANCHCOLLAPSED</strong>:
  the image that will be shown for all collapsed branches.
    Default:
    &quot;IMGCOLLAPSED&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>IMAGEBRANCHEXPANDED</strong>:
  the image that will be shown for all expanded branches.
    Default:
    &quot;IMGEXPANDED&quot;.</p>
<h3><a name="nodes">Nodes</a></h3>
<p><strong>TITLE</strong>:
  the text label of the 
  selected node. Using the &quot;<strong>TITLE</strong><b>id</b>&quot; form, where id is the node identifier, it is possible to 
  change the name of any node. </p>
<p><strong>STATE</strong>:
  the state of the 
  selected branch. Using the &quot;<b>STATEid</b>&quot; form, where id is the node identifier, it is possible to
  change the state of any branch. This attribute only works on branches. If used on a leaf, nothing will 
  happen. Possible values: </p>
    <blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>&quot;EXPANDED&quot;:
    Expanded branch state (shows its children)</li>
		<li>&quot;COLLAPSED&quot;:
    Collapsed branch state (hides its children)
    </li>
</ul>
    </blockquote>
    <p><strong>DEPTH </strong>(read only):
  returns the selected node's depth. Using the &quot;<b>DEPTHid</b>&quot; form, where id is the node identifier, it is possible to 
  refer to any node. </p>
<p><strong>KIND </strong>(read only):
  returns the kind of the selected node. Using 
  the &quot;<b>KINDid</b>&quot; form, where id is the node identifier, it is possible to 
  retrieve the kind of any node. Possible values: 
</p>
    <blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>&quot;LEAF&quot;:
    The node is a leaf</li>
		<li>&quot;BRANCH&quot;:
    The node is a branch</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PARENT </strong>(read only):
  returns the identifier of the selected 
  node's parent. Using the &quot;<b>PARENTid</b>&quot; form, where id is the node 
identifier, it is possible to retrieve the identifier of any node.</p>
<p><strong>COLOR</strong>:
  Color of the provided node. Using the form &quot;<b>COLORid</b>&quot;, where id is the node identifier, it is possible to 
  set or retrieve the color of any node. The value should be a string in the format &quot;R G B&quot; where R, G, B are numbers 
  from 0 to 255.</p>
<h3><a name="action">Action</a></h3>
<p><strong>ADDLEAF</strong><b>id</b><strong> </strong>(write only):
  Adds a new leaf 
after the reference node, where id is the reference node identifier. If id is 
empty, then the selected node is used as referece node. The value is used as the 
text label of the new node. The id of the new node will be the id of the 
reference node + 1. 
  The reference node is marked and all others unmaked. The reference node 
position remains the same. If the reference node does not exist, nothing 
happens. If the reference node is a branch then the depth of the new node is one 
depth increment from the depth of the reference node, if the reference node is a 
leaf then the new node has the same depth. If you need to 
add a node after a specified node but at a different depth use <strong>
INSERTLEAF</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>ADDBRANCHid </strong>(write only):
  Same as <strong>ADDLEAF</strong> for branches. Branches can be created 
expanded or collapsed depending on <strong>ADDEXPANDED</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>EXPANDALL </strong>(write only): expand or contracts all nodes. Can 
be YES (expand all), or NO (contract all). The root node always remains 
expanded. (since 3.0)</p>

<p><strong>DELNODEid </strong>(write only):
  Removes a node and or its children. The root cannot be removed. Possible values:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>&quot;SELECTED&quot;:
    deletes the specified node and its children</li>
  <li>&quot;CHILDREN&quot;:
    deletes only the children of the 
  specified node</li>
  <li>&quot;MARKED&quot;:
    deletes all marked nodes (and all their 
    children), id is always ignored</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>INSERTLEAFid</strong>, <strong>INSERTBRANCHid </strong>
(write only): Same as <strong>ADDLEAF</strong> and <strong>ADDBRACH</strong> but 
the depth of the new node is always the same of the reference node. 
(since 3.0)</p>
<p><b>RENAME</b><strong> </strong>(write only):<b> </b>Forces a rename action to take place. If SHOWRENAME=YES then 
  does in-place rename, else just calls the RENAMENODE_CB. The value is ignored.</p>
