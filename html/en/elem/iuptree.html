<h2>IupTree <span class="style1">(since 3.0)</span></h2>
<p>Creates a tree containing nodes of branches or leaves. Both branches and 
leaves can have an associated text and image.</p>
<p>The branches can be expanded or collapsed. When a branch is expanded, its immediate children are visible, and when it 
  is collapsed they are hidden.</p>
<p>The leaves can generate an &quot;executed&quot; or &quot;renamed&quot; actions, branches can only generate 
a &quot;renamed&quot; action. 
</p>
<p>The focus node is the node with the focus rectangle, marked nodes have their background inverted.

<h4>Hierarchy</h4>
<p>Branches can contain other branches or leaves. The tree always has at least one branch, 
  the <b>root</b>, which will be the parent of all the first level branches and leaves. 
The root node has id=0 and depth=0. The tree nodes have a sequencial identification number 
  (id), starting by the root, with id=0, and increases for each node independent 
from the node depth. The following picture ilustrates the numbering of the nodes 
in a tree.</p>
<p class="style2">
<img src="../../../../iup/html/en/elem/images/iuptree.png" width="165" height="279"><br>
<strong>Tree nodes and Ids</strong></p>
<p>Since you have to add each node the creation of this tree can be done in 
several ways because the action attributes ADD* and INSERT* use an existent node 
to position the new node. The following pseudo code initializes the tree from top to 
bottom sequencially:</p>
<pre>
TITLE0 = "Figures"
  ADDLEAF0 = "Other"    // Use the previous node as reference
  ADDBRANCH1 = "triangle"
    ADDLEAF2 = "equilateral"
    ADDLEAF3 = "isoceles"
    ADDLEAF4 = "scalenus"
  INSERTBRANCH2 = "parallelogram"  // Use the previous node at the same depth as reference
    ADDLEAF6 = "square"
    ADDLEAF7 = "diamond"
  INSERTBRANCH6 = "2D"
  INSERTBRANCH9 = "3D"
</pre>
<p>The following pseudo code initializes the tree from bottom to top 
sequencially (except for branches), and also uses the focus node:</p>
<pre>
VALUE = 0  // Set the focus node at the root (default for a new element)
TITLE = "Figures"
ADDBRANCH = "3D"
ADDBRANCH = "2D"
ADDBRANCH = "parallelogram"
ADDLEAF1 = "diamond"
ADDLEAF1 = "square"
ADDBRANCH = "triangle"
ADDLEAF1 = "scalenus"
ADDLEAF1 = "isoceles"
ADDLEAF1 = "equilateral"
ADDLEAF = "Other"
</pre>
<p>Notice that in both cases the initialization of the tree is highly dependent 
on the order of the operations. Currently we can NOT garantie the order before 
mapping to the native system, so the initialization must be performed after the 
tree is mapped.</p>
<p>Scrollbars are automatically displayed if the tree is greatter than its 
display area.</p>
<p>Branches may be added in IupLua using a Lua Table, see 
<a href="#TreeSetValue">TreeSetValue</a>.&nbsp; </p>
<h4>Manipulation</h4>
<p>Node insertion or removal is done by means 
  of attributes. It is allowed to remove nodes and branches inside callbacks associated to opening or closing branches.
  </p>
<p>This means that the user may insert nodes and branches only when necessary 
when the parent brach is opened, allowing the use of a larger IupTree without 
too much overhead. Then when the parent branch is closed the subtree can be 
removed. But the subtree mst have at least 1 item so the branch can be oppened 
and closed, empty branches can NOT be oppend.</p>
<h4>User Data</h4>
<p>The node Id does not always correspond to the same 
  node as the tree is modified. For example, a id=2 will always refer to the third node in the tree. For that 
  reason, there is also the <strong>USERDATAid</strong>, which allows identifying a specific node. The 
<strong>USERDATAid </strong>always refers to the same node. The <strong>
USERDATAid</strong> may contain a user-created structure with other informations 
for the node.</p>
<h4>Images</h4>
<p>IupTree has three types of images: one associated to the leaf, one to the collapsed branch and 
  the other to the expanded branch. Each image can be changed, both globally and individually.</p>
<p>The predefined images used in IupTree can be obtained by means of function IupGetHandle.The names of the 
  predefined images are: IMGLEAF, IMGCOLLAPSED, IMGEXPANDED, IMGBLANK (blank sheet of paper) and 
  IMGPAPER (written sheet of paper). By default:</p>
<pre>&quot;IMAGELEAF&quot; uses &quot;IMGLEAF&quot;
&quot;IMAGEBRANCHCOLLAPSED&quot; uses &quot;IMGCOLLAPSED&quot;
&quot;IMAGEBRANCHEXPANDED&quot; uses &quot;IMGEXPANDED&quot;</pre>
<pre>&quot;IMGBLANK&quot; and &quot;IMGPAPER&quot; are designed for use as &quot;IMAGELEAF&quot;</pre>
<h4>Simple Marking</h4>
<p>Is the IupTree&#8217;s default operation mode (MARKMODE=SINGLE). In this mode only one node can 
be selected.</p>
<h4>Multiple Marking</h4>
<p>IupTree allows marking several nodes simultaneously using the Shift and Control keys. To use 
  multiple marking set MARKMODE=MULTIPLE.</p>
<p>When a user keeps the Control key pressed, 
  the individual marking mode is used. This way, the focus node can be modified without changing the marked node. To 
  reverse a node marking, the user simply has to press the space bar.</p>
<p>When the user keeps the Shift key pressed, 
  the block marking mode is used. This way, all nodes between the focus node and the initial node are marked, and all 
  others are unmarked. The initial node is changed every time a node is marked without the Shift key being pressed. This 
  happens when any movement is done without Shift or Control keys being pressed, or when the space bar is pressed together 
  with Control.</p>
<h4><a name="navigation">Navigation</a></h4>
<p>Using the keyboard: </p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Arrow Up/Down</b>: Moves the focus node to the neighbor 
    node, according to the arrow direction.</li>
  <li><b>Home/End</b>: Moves the focus node to the root/last node.</li>
  <li><b>Page Up/Page Down</b>: Moves the focus node to the node one page above/below the 
    focus node.</li>
  <li><b>Enter</b>: If the focus node is an expanded branch, it is collapsed; if it is a collapsed
    branch, it is expanded; if it is a leaf, it is executed.</li>
	<li><b>Ctrl+Arrow Up/Down</b>: When selection mode is single moves only the 
	focus node.</li>
  <li><span class="style4">Ctrl+Space</span><span class="style3">:&nbsp;
    Marks or unmarks a node.</span></li>
	<li><strong>F2</strong>: Calls the rename callback or invoke the inplace 
	rename.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Motif when pressing Tab the focus goes to the next visible node, if there 
are no next visible node then the next control in the dialog receives the focus. 
In Windows and Gtk the focus simply goes directly to the next control.</p>
<p>Using the mouse: </p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Clicking a node</b>: Moves the focus node to the clicked node.</li>
  <li><b>Clicking a (-/+) box</b>: Makes the branch to the right of the (-/+) 
    box collapse/expand.</li>
  <li><b>Double-clicking a node</b>: 
	Moves the focus node to the clicked node. If the node is an expanded 
    branch, it is collapsed; if it is a collapsed branch, it is expanded; if it is a leaf, it is executed. 
  </li>
  <li><span class="style4">Double-clicking a node text</span><span class="style3">: Calls the rename callback 
    or invoke the inplace rename.</span></li>
</ul>
<h4>Removing a Node with &quot;Del&quot;</h4>
<p>By default the Del key is not processed, but you can implement it using a 
simple K_ANY callback:</p>
<pre>int k_any(Ihandle* ih, int c)
{
  if (c == K_DEL) 
   IupSetAttribute(ih,&quot;DELNODE&quot;,&quot;MARKED&quot;);
  return IUP_CONTINUE;
}</pre>
<h3>Extra Functions</h3>
<p>IupTree has functions that allow associating a pointer (or a user defined id) to 
  a node. In order to do that, you provide the id of the node and the pointer (userid); even 
  if the node's id changes later on, the userid will still be associated with the given node. In IupLua, instead of a 
  pointer the same functions are defined for table and userdata.</p>
<pre>int IupTreeSetUserId(Ihandle *<strong>ih</strong>, int <strong>id</strong>, void *<strong>userid</strong>); [in C]
iup.TreeSetUserId(<strong>ih: </strong>ihandle, <strong>id: </strong>number, <strong>userid: </strong>userdata/table) [in Lua]</pre>
<p><strong>ih</strong>:
      Identifier of the IupTree interacting with the user. <br>
<strong>id</strong>:
      Node identifier. <br>
<strong>userid</strong>:
      User pointer or Lua table to be associated with the node. 
      Use NULL (nil) value to remove the association.</p>
<p>Associates an userid with a given id. If the id of the node is changed, the 
userid remains the same.</p>
<p>Associations to Lua objects in Lua 5 are referenced in the Lua REGISTRY. So they can be retrieved later. This 
      means also that the associated object will not be garbage collected until its reference is removed. Also, the user should not use the same table to reference different nodes (neither in the same nor across 
      different trees.)</p>
<p>It is equivalent of setting the <strong>USERDATAid</strong> attribute.</p>
<pre>void* IupTreeGetUserId(Ihandle *<strong>ih</strong>, int <strong>id</strong>); [in C] 
iup.TreeGetUserId(<strong>ih: </strong>ihandle, <strong>id: </strong>number) -&gt; (<b>ret:</b> userdata/table) [in Lua]
</pre>
<p><strong>ih</strong>:
      Identifier of the IupTree interacting with the user. <br>
<strong>id</strong>:
      Node identifier.</p>
<p>Returns the pointer or Lua table associated to 
      the node or NULL if none was associated. <strong>SetUserId</strong> must 
have been called for the node with the given id.</p>
<p>It is equivalent of retrieving the <strong>USERDATAid</strong> attribute.</p>
<pre>int IupTreeGetId(Ihandle *<strong>ih</strong>, void *<strong>userid</strong>); [in C] 
iup.TreeGetId(<strong>ih: </strong>ihandle, <strong>userid: </strong>userdata/table) -&gt; (<b>ret:</b> number) [in Lua]
</pre>
<p><strong>ih</strong>:
      Identifier of the IupTree interacting with the user. <br>
<strong>userid</strong>:
      Pointer or Lua table associated to the node.</p>
<p>Returns the id of the node that has the userid on success or -1 
      (nil) if not found. <strong>SetUserId</strong> must have been called with 
the same userid.</p>
<p>It is equivalent of retrieving the <strong>FINDUSERDATAp</strong> 
attribute.</p>
<hr>



<pre>iup.<a name="TreeSetValue">TreeSetValue</a>(<strong>ih: </strong>ihandle, <strong>tree: </strong>table) [in Lua]</pre>
<p><strong>ih</strong>:
      Identifier of the IupTree interacting with the user.<br>
<strong>tree</strong>: table of nodes.</p>
<p>Initializes the tree using the given Lua table as values for the tree nodes. For example:</p>
<pre>tree = {
  {
    &quot;Horse&quot;,
    &quot;Whale&quot;;
    branchname = &quot;Mammals&quot;
  },
  {
    &quot;Shrimp&quot;,
    &quot;Lobster&quot;;
    branchname = &quot;Crustaceans&quot;
  };
  branchname = &quot;Animals&quot;
}
iup.TreeSetValue(handle, tree)</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Utility Functions </h3>
<p>These functions can be used to help set and get attributes from the tree:</p>
<pre>void  IupTreeSetAttribute (Ihandle *n, char* a, int id, char* v);
void  IupTreeStoreAttribute(Ihandle *n, char* a, int id, char* v);
char* IupTreeGetAttribute (Ihandle *n, char* a, int id);
int   IupTreeGetInt (Ihandle *n, char* a, int id);
float IupTreeGetFloat (Ihandle *n, char* a, int id);
void  IupTreeSetfAttribute (Ihandle *n, char* a, int id, char* f, ...);</pre>
<p>They work just like the respective tradicional set and get functions. But the attribute string is complemented with 
  the id value. For ex:</p>
<pre>IupTreeSetAttribute(n, &quot;KIND&quot; , 30, v) = IupSetAttribute(n, &quot;KIND30&quot;, v)
IupTreeSetAttribute(n, &quot;ADDLEAF&quot; , 10, v) = IupSetAttribute(n, &quot;ADDLEAF10&quot;, v)</pre>

contributed by Sergio Maffra and Frederico Abraham. It 
  is an utility wrapper in C++ for the IupTree.</p>
