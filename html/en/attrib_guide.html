<h2 style="text-align: center;" align="center">Attributes Guide</h2>

<h3><a name="Using">Using</a></h3>

<p>Attributes are a way to send and obtain information to and from elements. 
They are used by the application to communicate with the user interface system, 
on the other hand callbacks are used by the application to receive notifications 
from the system that the user or the system itself has interacted with the user 
interface of the application.</p>
<p>There are two functions to change them:</p>

<ul type="disc">

  <li><strong>IupSetAttribute</strong> stores only a pointer to the string and does not duplicate it. 
  </li>

  <li><strong>IupStoreAtribute</strong> duplicates the string, allowing you to use it for other purposes.</li>

</ul>

<p>With <strong>IupSetAttribute</strong> you can also store application pointers that can be 
strings or not. This can be very useful, for instance, used inside 
<b>callbacks</b>. For example, by storing a C pointer of an application defined structure, the application can retrieve 
  this pointer inside the callback through function 
  <strong>IupGetAttribute</strong>. Therefore, even if the callbacks are global functions, 
  the same callback can be used for several objects, even of different types.<u1:p>
</u1:p>
</p>

<p>When an attribute is updated (<b>Set</b>) it is  stored internally at the hash 
table of the control only if the driver implementation of the control class 
allows the storage.
  If the value is NULL, the attribute will also be removed from the hash table 
and the default value will be used if there is one defined.  Finally the attribute is 
updated for the children of the control if they do not 
  have the attribute defined in their own hash table. Here is a pseudo-code:</p>


<pre>IupSetAttribute(ih, name, value)<br>{<br>  if ih.SetClassAttribute(name, value)==store then<br>    ih.SetHashTableAttribute(name, value)<br>  endif<br><br>  if (ih.IsInheritable(name))<br>    -- NotifyChildren<br>    for each child of ih do<br>       if not child.GetHashTableAttribute(name) then<br>        child.SetClassAttribute(name, value)<br>        child.NotifyChildren(name, value)<br>       endif<br>    endfor<br>  endif<br>}</pre>

<p>When an attribute is retrieved (<b>Get</b>) it will first be checked at the 
driver implementation of the control class. If not defined then it checks in the hash table. If not defined 
it checks its parent hash table and so forth, until it reaches the dialog. And 
finally if still not defined then a 
  default value is returned (the default value can also be NULL).</p>

<pre>value = IupGetAttribute(ih, name)<br>{<br>  value = ih.GetClassAttribute(name)<br><br>  if not value then<br>    value = ih.GetHashTableAttribute(name)  <br>  endif<br><br>  if not value and ih.isInheritable(name) then<br>    parent = ih.parent<br>    while (parent and not value)<br>      value = parent.GetHashTableAttribute(name)<br>      parent = parent.parent<br>    endwhile<br>  endif<br><br>  if not value then<br>    value = ih.GetDefaultAttribute(name)  <br>  endif<br>}</pre>

<p>Notice that the parent recursion is done only for the parent hash table, the 
parent class implementation is not consulted.</p>

<p>The class implementation of the control can update or retrieve a value 
even if the control is not mapped. When the control is not mapped and its 
implementation can not process the attribute, then the attribute is simply 
stored in the hash table. After the element is mapped its attributes are 
re-processed to be updated in the native system and they can be removed from the 
hash table at that time.</p>

<p>All this flexibility turns the attribute system very complex with several 
nuances. If the attribute is checked before the control is mapped and just 
after, its value can be completely different. Depending on how the attribute is 
stored its inheritance can be completly ignored.</p>

<p>Attribute <span class="style1">names</span> are always upper case, lower case names will not work. But attribute 
<span class="style1">values</span> like "YES", "NO", 
  "TOP", are case insensitive, so "Yes", "no", "top", and other variations will work. 
</p>
<p>Boolean attributes accept the values "1", "YES", "ON" or "TRUE" for <b>true</b>, 
and NULL (not defined), "0", "NO", "OFF" or "FALSE" for <b>false</b>, even if in 
the documentation is only one of these combinations.</p>

<p>There are attributes common to all the elements. In some cases, common attributes behave 
  differently in different elements, but in such cases, there are comments in 
the documentation of the element explaining the different behavior.</p>

<p>In LED there is no  
  quotation marks for attributes, names or values. In Lua attribute names can be 
lower case.</p>

<h3><a name="Inheritance">Inheritance</a></h3>

<p>Elements included in other elements can inherit their attributes. There is an 
<b>inheritance</b> mechanism inside a given child tree. </p>

<p>This means, for example, that if you set the 
  "MARGIN" attribute of a vbox 
  containing several other elements, including other vboxes, all the elements depending on the attribute
  "MARGIN" will be affected, <span class="style1">except</span> for those who the
  "MARGIN" attribute is already defined.</p>

<p>Please note that not all attributes are inherited. <font size="3">As general 
rules the following attributes are <strong>NON</strong> inheritable always:</font></p>
<ul>
	<li><font size="3">Essencial attributes like VALUE, TITLE, SIZE, RASTERSIZE, 
	X and Y</font></li>
	<li><font size="3">Id numbered attributes (like &quot;1&quot; or &quot;MARK1:1&quot;)</font></li>
	<li>H<font size="3">andle names (like &quot;CURSOR&quot;, "IMAGE" and 
"MENU")</font></li>
	<li>Pointers that are not strings<font size="3"> </font>(like WID)</li>
	<li><font size="3">Read-only or 
write-only attributes</font></li>
	<li><font size="3">Internal attributes that starts with &quot;_IUP&quot;</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font size="3">Inheritable </font>attributes <font size="3">are stored in the hash table so the 
IupGet/SetAttribute logic can work, even if the element implementation store it 
internally. But w</font>hen you change an attribute to NULL, then its value is 
removed from the hash table and the default value if any is passed to the native 
system. Non <font size="3">inheritable attributes never have default values.</font></p>

<p>When consulted the attribute is first checked at the element
specific implementation. If not defined then it checks in the hash
table. If not defined in its hash table, the attribute will be
inherited from its parent's hash table and so forth, until it reaches
the root child (usually the dialog). But if still then the attribute is
not defined a default value for the element is returned (the default
value can also be NULL).</p>

<p>When changed the attribute change is propagated to all children except for those who the
  attribute is already defined.</p>

<p>Noticed that when changed the inheritance check is done for the current 
control. Since Vbox, Hbox, and other containers have only a few registered 
attributes, by default an unknown attribute is treated as inheritable. For 
example, the IMAGE attribute of a Label is not inheritable, so when checked at 
the Label it will return NULL if not defined, the Label parent tree will not be 
consulted. But if you change the IMAGE attribute at a Vbox that contains several 
Labels, the Vbox will not be affected but all child Labels will.</p>

<h3><a name="IupLua">IupLua</a></h3>

<p>Each interface element is created as a Lua table, and its attributes are fields in this table<b>.
  </b>Some of these attributes are directly transferred to IUP, so that any changes made to them immediately reflect on 
  the screen. However, not all attributes are transferred to IUP. </p>

<p>Control attributes, such as handle, 
  which stores the handle of the IUP element, and parent, which 
  stores the object immediately above in the class hierarchy, are not transfered. Attributes that receive strings or 
  numbers as values are immediately transferred to IUP. Other values (such as functions or objects) are stored in IupLua 
  and might receive special treatment.<u1:p> </u1:p>
</p>

<u1:p></u1:p>
<p>For instance, a button can be created as follows (defining a title and the background color): 
</p>

<pre>myButton = iup.button{title = "Ok", bgcolor = "0 255 0"}</pre>

<p>Font color can be subsequently changed by modifying the value of attribute
  fgcolor: </p>

<pre>myButton.fgcolor = "255 0 0"</pre>

<p>Note that the attribute names in C and in IupLua are the same, but in IupLua they can be written 
  in lower case. </p>

<p>In the creation of an element some parameters are required attributes (such as
  title in buttons). Their types are checked when the element 
  is created. The required parameters are exactly the paremeters that are necessary for the element to be created in C.</p>

<p>Some interface elements can contain one or more elements, as is the case of dialogs, lists and boxes. In such 
  cases, the object&rsquo;s element list is put together as a vector, that is, the elements are placed one after the other, 
  separated by commas. They can be accessed by indexing the object containing them, as can be seen in this example: 
</p>

<pre>mybox = iup.hbox{bt1, bt2, bt3}<br>mybox[1].fgcolor = "255 0 0"         -- changes bt1 foreground color<br>mybox[2].fgcolor = caixa[1].fgcolor  -- changes bt2 foreground color</pre>

<p>While the attributes receiving numbers or strings are directly transferred to IUP, attributes 
  receiving other interface objects are not directly transferred, because IUP only accepts strings as a value. The 
  method that transfers attributes to IUP verifies if the attribute value is a handle, that is, if it is an interface 
  element. If the element already has a name, this name is passed to IUP. If not, a new name is created, associated to 
  the element and passed to IUP as the value of the attribute being defined.<u1:p>
</u1:p>
</p>

<u1:p></u1:p>
<p>This policy is very useful for associating two interface elements, because you can abstract the fact that IUP uses 
  a string to make associations and imagine the interface element itself is being used.
