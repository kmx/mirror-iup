<h2>Win32 System Driver</h2>
<p>This driver was designed for the modern 
  Microsoft Windows in 32 bits or 64 bits (2000/XP/2003/Vista).</p>
<h3>DLL</h3>
<p>To use DLL, it is necessary to link the 
  application with the IUP.lib and IUPSTUB.lib libraries (for technical reasons, these libraries cannot be unified). Note that 
  IUP.lib is a library specially generated to work with 
  iup.dll, and is usually distributed in the same directory as 
  iup.dll. the IUP DLL depends on the MSVCRT.DLL, that it is already installed in Windows.</p>
<p>For the program to work, IUP.dll must be inside a PATH directory. Usually the program does not need to be relinked when 
  the DLL is updated.</p>
<h3>Tips</h3>
<h4>Visual C++ 6</h4>
<p>Since 3.0 Visual C++6 is not supported anymore. To compile the IUP 3 code 
with VC6 you will need to download a new
<a href="http://windowssdk.msdn.microsoft.com/">Platform SDK</a>, because the 
one included in the compiler is too old. But it cannot be a too new one also, 
because the compiler will report errors in the newest headers. So we recommend 
you to upgrade your compiler,
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/">Visual C++ Express 
Edition</a> is a free compiler that has with everything VC6 had.</p>
<h4>COM Initialization</h4>
<p>IupOpen calls &quot;CoInitializeEx(NULL, COINIT_APARTMENTTHREADED);&quot;, if you need another concurrency model call 
  CoInitializeEx with other options before calling IupOpen. Be aware that some features in some controls require 
  single-thread apartment, and they will stop working, this includes: IupFileDLg when selecting a folder, and IupOle.</p>
<h4>InitCommonCtrlEx Linker Error</h4>
<p>On Windows a common error occurs: 
  &quot;Cannot find function <b>InitCommonCtrlEx</b>()&quot;
  This error occurs if you forgot to add the
  comctl32.lib library to be linked with the program. This library is <b>not</b> usually in the 
  libraries list for the Visual C++, you must add it.</p>
<h4>Custom IupFileDlg </h4>
<p>To use some cursors and the preview area of <b>IupFileDlg</b> you must include the 
  &quot;iup.rc&quot; file into your makefile. Or include the contents of it into your resource file, you will need also to copy 
  the cursor files.</p>
<h4>Windows XP Visual Styles</h4>
<p>Windows XP Visual Styles can be enabled using a manifest file. Uncomment the manifest file section in &quot;iup.rc&quot; file or copy 
  it to your own resource file, you will need also to copy the manifest file &quot;iup.manifest&quot;.</p>
<p>When using Visual C++ 8 with &quot;iup.manifest&quot;, configure the linker properties 
of your project to do NOT generate a manifest file or the Windows XP Visual 
Styles won't work.</p>
<p>If your Windows XP is using the Windows Classic style or any other style, IUP 
controls appearance will follow the system appearance if you are using a 
Manifest. If not, it will always look like Windows Classic.</p>
<h4><b>Black Canvas</b></h4>
<p>The IupGLCanvas does not work when inside an IupFrame, the result is a black canvas with no drawing.</p>

<h4><b>Help in CHM format fail to open</b></h4>
<p>When you download a CHM file from the Internet Windows blocks your access to 
the file. You must unblock it manually. Right click the file in Explorer and 
select&nbsp; &quot;Unblock&quot; at the bottom of the dialog.</p>
