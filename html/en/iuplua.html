<h3>Exchanging &quot;Ihandle*&quot; between C and Lua</h3>
<p>Each binding to a version of Lua uses different features of the language in order to implement IUP handles (Ihandle) 
  in Lua. Therefore, functions have been created to help exchange references between Lua and C.</p>
<p>In C, to push an Ihandle in Lua's stack, use the function:</p>
<pre>iuplua_pushihandle(lua_State *L, Ihandle *ih);</pre>
<p>In C, to receive an Ihandle in a C function called from Lua, just use one of the following code:</p>
<pre>Ihandle* ih = *(Ihandle**)lua_touserdata(L, pos);</pre>
<p>or using parameter checking:</p>
<pre>Ihandle* iuplua_checkihandle(lua_State *L, int pos);</pre>
<p>In Lua, if the handle is a user data create with the above structure, but not mapped to a Lua object, use the 
  function:</p>
<pre>iup.RegisterHandle(handle, typename)</pre>
<p>where &quot;typename&quot; is the string returned in IupGetType(handle)</p>
<p>In Lua, to access a handle created in C as a Lua object, alternatively use the function:</p>
<pre>handle = iup.GetFromC(name)</pre>
<p class="MsoBodyText">where &quot;name&quot; is the name of the element previously defined with
    IupSetHandle.</p>
<h3>Error Handling</h3>
<p>In Lua 5 to improve the error report the following functions have been created to 
  execute Lua code:</p>
<pre>int iuplua_dofile(lua_State *L, char *filename);
int iuplua_dostring(lua_State *L, const char *string, const char *chunk_name);</pre>
<p>These functions mimics the implementation in the standalone interpreter for Lua 5, that displays the error message 
  followed by the stack.</p>
<p>If the these functions are used the errors will be reported through the &quot;iup._ERRORMESSAGE(msg)&quot; function. By 
  default _ERRORMESSAGE is defined to show a dialog with the error message.</p>
<p>When printing an Ihandle reference the returned string is &quot;IUP(<em>type</em>):
<em>address</em>&quot;, for example &quot;IUP(dialog): 08C55240&quot;.</p>
<h3>The Architecture of IupLua 5</h3>
<p>There are two important names in IupLua5: &quot;iup handle&quot; and &quot;iup widget&quot;. 
</p>
<p>When you create an IUP element in Lua 5 it is created a table with a metatable called &quot;iup widget&quot;. This metatable 
  has its &quot;__index&quot; method redefined so when an index is not defined it looks for it in the &quot;parent&quot; table. The table it 
  self represents the class of the control. And all the classes inherit the implementation of the base class WIDGET. 
  Each control class must implement the &quot;createElement&quot; method of the class. The WIDGET class also a member called 
  &quot;handle&quot; that contains the Ihandle* in Lua. The constructor of the WIDGET class returns the handle. 
</p>
<p>The Ihandle* is represented in Lua as a table with a metatable called &quot;iup handle&quot;. This metable has its &quot;__index&quot;, 
  &quot;__newindex&quot; and &quot;__eq&quot; methods redefined. The index methods are used to implement the set and get attribute facility. 
  The handle knows its class because it is stored in its &quot;parent&quot; member.</p>
<p>Since the controls creation is done by the &quot;iup.&lt;control&gt;&quot; function, the application does not use the WIDGET class 
  directly. All the time the application only uses the handle.</p>
<p>So for example the IupLabel:</p>
<pre>iup.label <b>calls</b> iup.LABEL:constructor
<b>since</b> iup.LABEL.parent = iup.WIDGET <b>and</b><span style="background-color: #CEE7FF"> </span>iup.LABEL:constructor <b>is not implemented</b>
it<b> calls</b><span style="background-color: #CEE7FF"> </span>iup.WIDGET:constructor  
<b>then</b> iup.WIDGET:constructor <b>calls</b> iup.LABEL:createElement    
<b>and finally returns the created</b> handle</pre>
<p>The complete class hierarchy for the standard controls can be represented as follows: 
</p>
<pre>WIDGET
   BUTTON
   ITEM
   TOGGLE
   CANVAS
   BOX
      HBOX
      VBOX
      ZBOX
      MENU
   DIALOG
   FILL
   FRAME
   IMAGE
   LABEL
   LIST
   RADIO
   SEPARATOR
   SUBMENU
   TEXT
   MULTILINE</pre>
