<h1 align="center">Additional Controls</h1>
<h2>Controls Library</h2>
<p>Most of the additional controls are included in only one library. Some of these controls are drawn by IUP and are 
  not native controls.</p>
<p>The <b>iupcontrols.h</b> file must be included in the source code. If you plan to use the control in Lua, you 
  should also include <b>iupluacontrols.h</b>.</p>
<p>The <b>IupControlsOpen</b> function must be called after <b>IupOpen</b>. To make the controls available in Lua, use the initialization function in C, 
<b>iupcontrolslua_open</b>, after calling <b>iuplua_open</b>.</p>
<p>Your application must be linked to the CPI 
  control library (<strong>iupcontrols</strong>), the CD_IUP driver (<strong>iupcd</strong>), and with the 
<a href="http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/cd" target="_top">CD</a> 
  library (<strong>cd</strong>). To use its bindings to Lua, the program must also be linked to the 
<strong>iupluacontrols</strong> library.</p>
<h2>OpenGL Canvas</h2>
<p>The drawing canvas compatible with OpenGL is called 
<a href="ctrl/iupglcanvas.html">IupGLCanvas</a>.</p>
