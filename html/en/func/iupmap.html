<h2>IupMap</h2>
<p>Creates (<b>maps</b>) the native interface objects 
  corresponding to the given IUP interface elements. </p>
<p>It will also create the native element of all the children in the element's tree.</p>
<p>The element must be already <b>attached</b> to a container if not a dialog.</p>
<h3>
Parameters/Return</h3>
<pre>int IupMap(Ihandle* <strong>ih</strong>); [in C]
iup.Map(<strong>ih</strong>: iuplua-tag) -&gt; <strong>ret</strong>: number [in Lua]</pre>
<p><b>ih</b>: Identifier of an interface element.</p>
<p>If the element was already mapped returns IUP_NOERROR.</p>
<p>If the native creation failed returns IUP_ERROR.</p>
<p>Return IUP_NOERROR if successful.</p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>If the element is a dialog then the abstract layout will be updated even if the element is already mapped. If the 
  dialog is visible the elements will be immediately repositioned. Calling
<strong>IupMap</strong> for an already mapped dialog is the same as only calling
<strong>IupRefresh</strong> for the dialog.</p>
<p>If you add new elements to an already mapped dialog you must call
  <b>IupMap</b> for that elements. And then call <b>IupRefresh</b> to update the dialog layout.</p>
<p>If the WID attribute is NULL, it means the element was not already mapped. 
Some containers do not have a native element associated, like VBOX and HBOX. In 
this case their WID is a fake (-1) value.</p>
<p>A child is only mapped if its parent is already mapped.</p>
<p>This function is automatically called before 
  the dialog is shown in 
  <b>IupShow</b>, 
  <b>IupShowXY</b> or 
  <b>IupPopup</b>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>It is usefull for the application to call
  <b>IupMap</b> when the value of the WID attribute must be known, or the native element 
must exist, before a dialog is made visible.</p>
<p>The
  MAP_CB callback is called just after the native element is created and the dialog layout updated, so it can 
  also be used to create other things that depend on
  the WID attribute.</p>
