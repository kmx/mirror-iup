<h2>IupGetAttribute</h2>
<p>Returns the name of an interface element attribute. See also the
<a href="../attrib_guide.html">Attributes Guide</a> section.</p>
<h3>
Parameters/Return</h3>
<pre>char *IupGetAttribute(Ihandle *<strong>ih</strong>, const char *<strong>name</strong>); [in C]
iup.GetAttribute(<strong>ih</strong>: ihandle, <strong>name</strong>: string) -&gt; <strong>value</strong>: string [in Lua]</pre>
<p><b>ih</b>: Identifier of the interface element. If
  NULL will retrieve from the global environment.<br>
  name: name of the attribute.</p>
<p>This function returns attribute&#8217;s value. If 
  the attribute does not exist, NULL (nil in IupLua) is returned.</p>
<a NAME="comentarios"></a>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>This function&#8217;s return value is not 
  necessarily the same one used by the application to define the attribute&#8217;s value. The subsequent call to the 
  <b>IupGetAttribute</b> function may change the contents of the previously returned pointer, as this is an 
  internal IUP buffer. The user is in charge of storing the value before calling any other IUP function. 
</p>
<p>The user has to understand that there is a 
  difference between IUP attributes, such as VALUE or SIZE, and those stored for the user. The IUP attributes are often dynamically computed, stored in a 
  temporary buffer and returned for the user to have access to the values. In the case of attributes stored for the 
  user, the pointer returned by <b>IupGetAttribute</b> will be the same as the stored pointer, allowing the contents to be changed. 
</p>
<p>The pointers of internal IUP attributes 
  returned by <strong>IupGetAttribute</strong> must <b>never</b> be freed or changed.</p>
<h4>Inheritance</h4>
<p>The attribute is first checked at the element specific implementation. If not defined then it checks in the
  attribute environment. If not defined in its
  attribute environment, the attribute will be inherited from its parent
  attribute environment and so forth, until it reaches the dialog. But if still then the attribute is not defined 
  a default value for the element is returned (the default value can also be NULL). 
Inheritance can be blocked by the element implementation.</p>
<h4>IupLua</h4>
<p>In IupLua, only known internal pointer attributes are returned as user data, all other attributes are returned as 
  strings. To access attribute data always as user data use iup.GetAttributeData:</p>
<pre>iup.GetAttributeData(<strong>ih</strong>: ihandle) -&gt; <strong>value</strong>: userdata [in Lua]</pre>
