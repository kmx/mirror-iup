Keyboard</h2>
<p>Keyboard navigation is the dialog uses the &quot;Tab&quot; key to 
  change the keyboard focus from one control to another. All IUP interactive 
  controls have Tab stops, but the navigation order is related to the order the 
  controls are placed in the dialog and can not be changed. When the focus is at 
  a Multiline control to change focus the combination &quot;Ctrl+Tab&quot; must be used, 
  because &quot;Tab&quot; is a valid character for the Multiline. The application can also 
  control the focus using the functions: <strong>IupGetFocus</strong>, 
<strong>IupSetFocus</strong>,
  <strong>IupNextField</strong> and 
<strong>IupPreviousField</strong>. And when the 
  focus is changed the application is notified trough the callbacks 
GETFOCUS_CB and 
KILLFOCUS_CB.</p>
<p>Two keys are also important in keyboard navigation: 
  &quot;Enter&quot; and &quot;Esc&quot;. But they are only active is the application register the 
  attributes DEFAULTENTER and DEFAULTESC of the
  <a href="dlg/iupdialog.html">IupDialog</a>. These attributes 
  configure buttons to be activated when the respective key is pressed. Again 
  &quot;Enter&quot; is a valid key for the Multiline so the combination &quot;Ctrl+Enter&quot; must 
  be used instead. If the focus is at a button then the Enter key will activate 
  this button independent from the DEFAULTENTER attribute.</p>
<p>Usualy the application will process keyboard input in the 
  canvas using the KEYPRESS_CB 
  callback. But there is also the K_ANY 
  callback that can be used for all the controls, but it does not have control 
  of the press state. Both callbacks use the key codification explained in
  <a href="attrib/key.html">Keyboard Codes</a>. These codes are also used in the
  ACTION callbacks of <strong>IupText</strong> 
  and <strong>IupMultiline</strong>, and in 
  shortcuts for menu items and submenus using the KEY attribute of <strong>IupItem</strong> and 
<strong>IupSubmenu</strong>. Finally all the keyboard 
  codes can be used as callback names to implement application hot keys.</p>
